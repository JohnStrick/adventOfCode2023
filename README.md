# Advent of Code 2023
My personal solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) 2023.

# Common Usage
`npm start [day number]` starts executing the solution for a certain day. For example pass `02` to execute the solution for day #2.

If a directory doesn't already exist, it will automatically create it using the day number passed in to `npm start`. You also need to modify [dayMap.ts](https://github.com/JohnStrick/adventOfCode2023/blob/main/src/dayMap.ts) to include the new `index.ts` file.
